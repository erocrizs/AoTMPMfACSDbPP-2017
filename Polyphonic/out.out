code-switched? true	 time: 13:37:17
jo 

id: 2 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? true	 time: 13:38:49
yeah 

id: 3 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:39:01
are you now on the first problem 

id: 4 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:39:09
i'm still on the 2nd problem 

id: 5 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? true	 time: 13:39:20
scanner input 

id: 6 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:39:40
yes the ones with x y z 

id: 7 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:39:46
where do you think is the error 

id: 8 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:40:01
i think there is a need for declaration before putting scanner 

id: 9 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:40:29
int x y z has no 

id: 10 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:40:34
but i think i'm not sure 

id: 11 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:40:43
int x y z is wrong 

id: 12 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? true	 time: 13:40:44
go 

id: 13 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:41
is problem 1 a 1error problem 

id: 14 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:41:17
i have 2 errors 

id: 15 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:41:31
you need to do instantiation in order to perform scanner 

id: 16 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:41:34
i think 

id: 17 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:41:56
what is instantiation again 

id: 18 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:42:20
code about static scanner etc 

id: 19 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:42:28
before the void main 

id: 20 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:43:04
i don't remember 

id: 21 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:43:23
i already proceeded to the next problem i've got 2 errors too but we've got different error locations 

id: 22 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:45:07
mic do all of the problems have errors 

id: 23 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:45:14
are you now in problem 2 

id: 24 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:45:16
i think all of the problems have errors 

id: 25 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:45:32
base it on the problem jo 

id: 26 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:45:49
yes 

id: 27 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:46:20
hey i think i clicked something wrong how do you remove the circle 

id: 28 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? true	 time: 13:46:24
reset 

id: 29 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:46:31
jo in problem 2 i already see the error 

id: 30 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:46:33
the error is in the for loop 

id: 31 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:46:35
because the code has 

id: 32 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:46:48
just press alt tab 

id: 33 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:48:42
but i think there are cases where you can put right i'm not sure though 

id: 34 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:48:50
hey you can't 

id: 35 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:48:51
mic can you clarify 1 to me 

id: 36 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? true	 time: 13:48:55
okay haha 

id: 37 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:49:06
i just only encircled the for now 

id: 38 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:49:08
i'll just do it later 

id: 39 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:49:18
it'll go farther later 

id: 40 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:50:47
it's okay at least we're sure that is the error 

id: 41 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:50:51
i'm here now in problem 3 

id: 42 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:51:09
i think the line with the scanner is wrong since you don't really need to do scanner since the problem has no input 

id: 43 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:51:16
then the code should all be println 

id: 44 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:51:57
wait i'm being stupid haha you don't have to encircle the instructions per problem right 

id: 45 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:52:06
no 

id: 46 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:52:11
the instruction is actually your basis 

id: 47 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:53:05
yes i think that's the only one 

id: 48 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:57:48
mic in problem 4 the for(i:=0 something) shouldn't be in the code right 

id: 49 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:57:55
there should be no := 

id: 50 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? true	 time: 13:57:55
i:=0 

id: 51 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:58:01
then you have to be cautious on the last part 

id: 52 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? true	 time: 13:58:08
okay 

id: 53 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? true	 time: 13:58:15
s(i) is supposed to be s1 

id: 54 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:58:22
yes i saw that one 

id: 55 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:58:28
did you see the 3 errors in your lower right jo 

id: 56 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 13:58:34
the lower right is the indication as to how many errors are there 

id: 57 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 13:59:06
ah okay okay 

id: 58 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:00:30
are you already in problem 5 

id: 59 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? true	 time: 14:02:11
8 

id: 60 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:02:22
yes i just saw one error still 

id: 61 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:02:27
what is the error 

id: 62 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:02:40
the 1st if 

id: 63 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:02:44
the code should be == 

id: 64 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:02:47
yes you're right 

id: 65 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:02:55
i think the next error is the systemexit 

id: 66 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:02:58
i quite don't know actually about systemexit 

id: 67 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:03:06
because at the part where there is match in an if i think there's no error in there 

id: 68 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:04:17
but i think the program is right because the program'll do exit if it's already less than 0 

id: 69 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? true	 time: 14:04:23
(y) 

id: 70 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:04:28
because there are 3 errors haha 

id: 71 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:04:58
by the way is a string capital or small 

id: 72 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:05:21
i think it should be any 

id: 73 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:05:32
but still count = 1 is count right 

id: 74 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? true	 time: 14:05:34
i don't know 

id: 75 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:06:15
count = 1 if it's an increment 

id: 76 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:07:15
so do you think that's the other error i don't know 

id: 77 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:07:26
i'm confused because i can't really find some errors for some others 

id: 78 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:07:31
me too 

id: 79 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:07:45
so i'm assuming the error is the count = 1 

id: 80 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:07:50
because there are no other errors 

id: 81 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:07:56
considering that the systemexit is right 

id: 82 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:08:04
then let's just consider these 2 errors first haha 

id: 83 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:08:07
so that we can go to the next problem 

id: 84 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? true	 time: 14:08:43
okay 

id: 85 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:08:53
p06 

id: 86 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:10:57
why is the number is placed outside 

id: 87 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? true	 time: 14:11:11
what number 

id: 88 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:11:12
because the number has to be inside the for loop right 

id: 89 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? true	 time: 14:11:15
p06 

id: 90 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:11:56
that's what i thought at first too but i think it's just basically 1 try so it's indirectly an else 

id: 91 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:12:37
then for all your cases all no will show up 

id: 92 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:13:13
there is actually a return will the program gonna terminate after that 

id: 93 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:14:08
i can't seem to really find an error 

id: 94 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:14:11
are you done 

id: 95 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:14:18
not yet 

id: 96 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:14:22
i can't really find an error 

id: 97 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:14:25
that's why i proceeded to p07 

id: 98 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:14:40
i only got the error in for loop 

id: 99 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:16:08
where is it exactly 

id: 100 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:18:18
the one that's 

id: 101 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? true	 time: 14:18:27
j=0 

id: 102 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:18:40
i think j=0 seems fine 

id: 103 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:18:51
you can actually declare as many times as you want in for loop as long as it's not 

id: 104 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? true	 time: 14:19:10
huh 

id: 105 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:19:19
remember is the separator right 

id: 106 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:19:21
not 

id: 107 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:19:27
's not actually a separator 

id: 108 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:19:33
it actually declares two 

id: 109 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:19:36
that's possible 

id: 110 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:20:30
so the ones between j and k what do you call that one 

id: 111 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:20:33
it should be 

id: 112 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? true	 time: 14:20:35
or 

id: 113 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:20:44
yes 

id: 114 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:20:52
are you now in p07 

id: 115 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:20:59
because only 3 is allowed in for loop 

id: 116 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? true	 time: 14:21:02
yes 

id: 117 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:21:18
so what's your error 

id: 118 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:21:47
the one that's = 

id: 119 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:21:52
and the one where there is no as well 

id: 120 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:21:58
because i can't really find anything anymore 

id: 121 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:22:11
i mean in p07 

id: 122 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? true	 time: 14:22:28
'player 2' 

id: 123 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:22:44
who wins () should have an argument 

id: 124 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:22:51
then the else system 

id: 125 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? true	 time: 14:23:12
okay 

id: 126 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:25:21
i think in p08 you can't declare if the types aren't compatible 

id: 127 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:25:30
like int k = odd odd is a char 

id: 128 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:25:43
but then you still have to parse the variable 

id: 129 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:26:21
i think it's an int you have to instantiate 

id: 130 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:26:29
right :'((( 

id: 131 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:26:36
i'm not sure haha 

id: 132 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:26:40
but then it's already in nextint() during scan 

id: 133 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:27:20
how many errors you've got already 

id: 134 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:27:23
time's almost up 

id: 135 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? true	 time: 14:27:26
help 

id: 136 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:27:49
i think that's all the errors the ones i encircle 

id: 137 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:27:51
because i really can't think of anything 

id: 138 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:27:58
but there are 3 of them 

id: 139 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? true	 time: 14:28:18
int k = odd 

id: 140 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? true	 time: 14:28:26
char length = odd 2 

id: 141 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:28:35
i marked that as an error 

id: 142 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:28:44
i think it's possible that int k = odd be an error 

id: 143 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:28:51
because i marked char odd as an error 

id: 144 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:29:04
i think we should proceed now haha 

id: 145 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:29:11
i am missing one more 

id: 146 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:30:29
the one that's i= length 

id: 147 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:31:01
i= length is actually correct in my case 

id: 148 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:31:11
let's switch first to p09 haha 

id: 149 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:34
help haha 

id: 150 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:34:04
i can't find anything 

id: 151 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? true	 time: 14:34:11
same haha 

id: 152 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:34:15
let's now proceed to p10 

id: 153 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? true	 time: 14:34:57
check p09 

id: 154 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? true	 time: 14:35:05
print(' ') 

id: 155 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:35:10
i already have that 

id: 156 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A Jo
code-switched? false	 time: 14:35:13
that one as well 

id: 157 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:35:15
it should be print(' ') 

id: 158 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? true	 time: 14:35:19
nice 

id: 159 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B Mic
code-switched? false	 time: 14:35:20
so let's proceed now
