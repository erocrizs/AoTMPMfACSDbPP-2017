id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? true	 time: 13:37:17
Jo? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? true	 time: 13:38:49
Yeah? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:39:01
Are you now on the first problem? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:39:09
I'm still on the 2nd problem 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? true	 time: 13:39:20
Scanner input? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:39:40
Yes. The ones with x y z 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:39:46
Where do you think is the error? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:40:01
I think there is a need for declaration before putting Scanner 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:40:29
int x, y, z has no ";" 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:40:34
But I think I'm not sure 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:40:43
int x, y, z is wrong 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? true	 time: 13:40:44
Go! 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:41
Is problem 1 a 1-error problem? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:41:17
I have 2 errors 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:41:31
You need to do instantiation in order to perform Scanner 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:41:34
I think. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:41:56
What is instantiation again? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:42:20
Code about static scanner, etc. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:42:28
Before the void main 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:43:04
I don't remember 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:43:23
I already proceeded to the next problem, I've got 2 errors too, but we've got different error locations 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:45:07
Mic, do all of the problems have errors? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:45:14
Are you now in problem 2? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:45:16
I think all of the problems have errors. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:45:32
Base it on the problem, Jo. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:45:49
Yes. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:46:20
Hey. I think I clicked something wrong. How do you remove the circle? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? true	 time: 13:46:24
Reset 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:46:31
Jo, in problem 2, I already see the error. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:46:33
The error is in the "for loop" 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:46:35
Because the code has ";" 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:46:48
Just press alt tab 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:48:42
But I think there are cases where you can put ";", right? I'm not sure though. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:48:50
Hey, you can't. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:48:51
Mic, can you clarify #1 to me? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? true	 time: 13:48:55
Okay. Haha 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:49:06
I just only encircled the ";" for now 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:49:08
I'll just do it later 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:49:18
It'll go farther later 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:50:47
It's okay. At least we're sure that ";" is the error 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:50:51
I'm here now in problem 3 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:51:09
I think the line with the Scanner is wrong since you don't really need to do Scanner since the problem has no input 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:51:16
Then the code should all be println 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:51:57
Wait! I'm being stupid. Haha. You don't have to encircle the instructions per problem, right? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:52:06
No. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:52:11
The instruction is actually your base/basis. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:53:05
Yes. I think that's the only one. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:57:48
Mic, in problem 4, the for(i:=0; -something-) shouldn't be in the code, right? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:57:55
There should be no := 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? true	 time: 13:57:55
i:=0 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:58:01
Then you have to be cautious on the last part 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? true	 time: 13:58:08
Okay 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? true	 time: 13:58:15
s(i) is supposed to be s[1] 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:58:22
Yes. I saw that one. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:58:28
Did you see the 3 errors in your lower right, Jo? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 13:58:34
The lower right is the indication as to how many errors are there. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 13:59:06
Ah okay, okay. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:00:30
Are you already in problem 5? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? true	 time: 14:02:11
8-| 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:02:22
Yes. I just saw one error, still. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:02:27
What is the error? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:02:40
The 1st "if" 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:02:44
The code should be == 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:02:47
Yes. You're right. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:02:55
I think, the next error is the system.exit 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:02:58
I quite don't know actually about system.exit. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:03:06
Because at the part where there is MATCH in an "if", I think there's no error in there. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:04:17
But I think the program is right, because the program'll do exit if it's already less than 0 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? true	 time: 14:04:23
(Y) 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:04:28
Because there are 3 errors, haha. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:04:58
By the way, is a string capital or small? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:05:21
I think it should be any 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:05:32
But still, count += 1 is count++; right? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? true	 time: 14:05:34
I don't know. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:06:15
count += 1 if it's an increment 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:07:15
So, do you think that's the other error? I don't know. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:07:26
I'm confused because I can't really find some errors for some others 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:07:31
Me too. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:07:45
So I'm assuming the error is the count += 1. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:07:50
Because there are no other errors. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:07:56
Considering that the system.exit is right 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:08:04
Then let's just consider these 2 errors first. Haha 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:08:07
So that we can go to the next problem. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? true	 time: 14:08:43
Okay. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:08:53
P06 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:10:57
Why is the number is placed outside? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? true	 time: 14:11:11
What number? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:11:12
Because the number has to be inside the "for loop", right? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? true	 time: 14:11:15
p06 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:11:56
That's what I thought at first too. But I think it's just basically 1 try so it's indirectly an else. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:12:37
then for all your cases, all NO will show up 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:13:13
There is actually a Return, will the program gonna terminate after that? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:14:08
I can't seem to really find an error 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:14:11
Are you done? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:14:18
Not yet. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:14:22
I can't really find an error. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:14:25
That's why I proceeded to p07 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:14:40
I only got the error in "for loop" 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:16:08
Where is it exactly? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:18:18
The one that's "," 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? true	 time: 14:18:27
j=0, 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:18:40
I think j=0, seems fine. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:18:51
You can actually declare as many times as you want in for loop as long as it's not ; 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? true	 time: 14:19:10
Huh? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:19:19
Remember, ";" is the separator, right? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:19:21
Not "," 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:19:27
","'s not actually a separator 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:19:33
It actually declares two 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:19:36
That's possible? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:20:30
So, the ones between j++ and k--, what do you call that one? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:20:33
It should be , 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? true	 time: 14:20:35
or ; 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:20:44
Yes? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:20:52
Are you now in p07? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:20:59
Because only 3 ";" is allowed in for loop 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? true	 time: 14:21:02
Yes 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:21:18
So what's your error? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:21:47
The one that's != 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:21:52
And the one where there is NO as well 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:21:58
Because I can't really find anything anymore 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:22:11
I mean in p07? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? true	 time: 14:22:28
'player 2' 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:22:44
who wins () -- should have an argument 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:22:51
then the else System 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? true	 time: 14:23:12
Okay 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:25:21
I think in p08, you can't declare if the types aren't compatible 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:25:30
Like int k = odd? Odd is a char 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:25:43
But then you still have to parse the variable 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:26:21
I think it's an int you have to instantiate 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:26:29
Right???? :'((( 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:26:36
I'm not sure. Haha 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:26:40
But then, it's already in nextInt() during scan 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:27:20
How many errors you've got already? 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:27:23
Time's almost up. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? true	 time: 14:27:26
Help. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:27:49
I think that's all the errors. The ones I encircle. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:27:51
Because I really can't think of anything. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:27:58
But there are 3 of them. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? true	 time: 14:28:18
int k = odd 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? true	 time: 14:28:26
char length = odd / 2 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:28:35
I marked that as an error 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:28:44
I think it's possible that int k = odd, be an error 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:28:51
Because I marked char odd as an error 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:29:04
I think we should proceed now! Haha 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:29:11
I am missing one more. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:30:29
The one that's i<= length 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:31:01
i<= length is actually correct in my case 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:31:11
Let's switch first to p09. Haha 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:34
Help! Haha 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:34:04
I can't find anything. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? true	 time: 14:34:11
Same. Haha 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:34:15
Let's now proceed to p10! 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? true	 time: 14:34:57
Check p09 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? true	 time: 14:35:05
print(' '); 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:35:10
I already have that. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02A
code-switched? false	 time: 14:35:13
That one as well. 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:35:15
It should be print(' ') 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? true	 time: 14:35:19
Nice 

id: 0 	 speaker: ADDU-SP02B
code-switched? false	 time: 14:35:20
So, let's proceed now.
